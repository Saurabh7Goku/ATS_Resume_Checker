# ATS Resume Checker

## Project Overview

The **ATS Resume Checker** is a tool designed to simplify the job application process by providing a comprehensive analysis of your resume against a provided job description. The primary goal is to enhance your chances of success in the applicant tracking system (ATS) by ensuring your resume aligns with the requirements of the targeted job.

## Features

### 1. Score My Resume
The "Score My Resume" feature evaluates your resume based on relevant points extracted from the provided job description. The tool assesses how well your qualifications, skills, and experience match the desired criteria, providing you with a numerical score.

### 2. Percentage Matching
The "Percentage Matching" feature compares your resume with the job description, highlighting the percentage match of keywords and phrases. This helps you identify areas of strength and areas that may need improvement to increase your chances of passing through ATS filters.
